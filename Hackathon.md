About BCH-1

Most hackathons move fast, but burn out. Most accelerators offer structure, but move slow.

We hybridized the model: the momentum of a hackathon with just enough scaffolding to help projects gain real traction.
We Don't Judge Just by Code — We Reward Traction

Projects are ranked by both technical merit and potential narrative traction. Social posts, community reactions, presentation quality, and use-case design all matter.

We want builders who want to ship and be seen.
